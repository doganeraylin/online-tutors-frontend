# Online Learning Platform
### Playful Minds is a captivating online learning platform tailored for children, where I showcased my design skills by crafting the entire website from scratch. The platform strives to offer an imaginative and interactive learning journey for kids. 
## ***Demo:*** https://online-tutors-frontend.vercel.app/

## Project Highlights
- created the website using Next.js, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, and the JSON Server package for creating a mock API.
- the platform offers a list of tutors, and clicking on a specific tutor directs users to a tutor details page.
- register and login functionalities have form validation to ensure secure account creation and login.
- sections of the website come to life with captivating animations, adding a layer of interactivity to the learning journey.
- adopted a mobile-first approach and implemented a responsive design to ensure seamless user experience across different devices.
- utilized ChatGPT to generate content for tutor profiles and the informative content.

## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
